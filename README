CMConvert - CacheMate import file converter

This program is used to convert EasyGPS XML file formats (LOC and GPX) to 
a format that can be installed onto a Palm OS device and imported into 
CacheMate.  Options are also available to list waypoints contained in an 
XML file, and selectively convert specified waypoints.

CMConvert requires the Expat XML parser library.  This library is 
available at:

	http://expat.sourceforge.net/

The following libraries are also required for ZIP file support.  This is 
an optional feature, and will be disabled if these libraries cannot be 
found.

	zziplib		http://zziplib.sourceforge.net/
	zlib		http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

If ZIP file support is enabled, and such a file is given as an input file,
CMConvert will search it (by extension) for a GPX file, and take its input
from the first one it finds.  Subsequent GPX files or other files in the 
ZIP file are ignored.

For instructions on compiling and installation of CMConvert, please read 
the INSTALL file, located in the top level distribution directory.  For 
information on using the program, refer to the included man page.
