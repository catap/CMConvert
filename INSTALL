CMConvert - CacheMate import file converter

CMConvert requires the Expat XML parser library.  This library is 
available at:

	http://expat.sourceforge.net/

CMConvert also has the ability to read GPX files from within ZIP files (as
they are received from Geocaching.com pocket queries).  If you want this
functionality, the following libraries must also be installed:

	zziplib		http://zziplib.sourceforge.net/
	zlib		http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

To build CMConvert, you first run the configuration shell script in the 
top level distribution directory:

	./configure

If you are building CMConvert under Mac OS X, use the following command 
line to put the manual page in the proper place:

	./configure --mandir=/usr/local/share/man

If the Expat library cannot be found, but you know it is installed, you
may use a --with-expat-dir parameter with the configure script to tell it
where to look.  This can happen particularly when Expat is installed as
part of a package.  An example might be:

	./configure --with-expat-dir=/opt/expat

That option adds /opt/expat/include to the search list for include files, 
and /opt/expat/lib to the library search list.  Directories for certain 
Mac OS X packages that include Expat are as follows:

	Darwin Ports	/opt/local
	Fink		/sw

Similar options are available for zziplib and zlib.

After the configure script has completed, run the following commands to
build and install the software (run the second command as root, if you are
installing in a system directory):

	make
	make install

There are many options which you may provide to configure (which you can
discover by running configure with the --help option).  But the one of
most interest is the one that sets the installation directory. By default,
the configure script will set things up to install cmconvert into
/usr/local/bin and the man page into /usr/local/man/man1.  If, for
example, you'd prefer to install into /usr/bin and /usr/man/man1, you can
tell configure about that with:

	./configure --prefix=/usr

After running the configuration script, run "make" to build the program,
and "make install" to install the files into their proper locations.  You
will need write permission to the install destinations for installation to
work.
