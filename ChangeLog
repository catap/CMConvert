2004-09-12	Version 1.8.6

	* Added "excl" command line parameter, for excluding waypoint IDs
	  from the converted file

2004-09-03

	* Added preliminary support for GPX 1.1 (no Groundspeak 
	  extensions, since they haven't been merged in yet)
	* Added support for multiple URLs per waypoint (first URL that
	  looks like a geocaching.com cache page is taken for the cache
	  URL... any others are taken as added links for the generated
	  HTML file)
	* Move long waypoint descriptions to description field (instead of 
	  name field) in the case of non-geocache GPX files without
	  Groundspeak extensions, and copy waypoint name to name field in 
	  those cases

2004-04-27	Version 1.8.5

	* Added use of file timestamp if GPX timestamp not detected

2004-04-06	Version 1.8.4

	* Added option to semi-intelligently strip quotes from cache names

2004-03-21	Version 1.8.3

	* Added proper duplicate resolution, for GPX files that contain 
	  timestamps
	* Added to documentation to explain just how duplicate record
	  resolution works in CMConvert, partly to explain the
	  "duplicates" that some people were seeing before

2004-03-05	Version 1.8.2

	* Added option to add cache active/inactive status to description
	* Added filters for active/inactive caches
	* Improved handling of incorrect list HTML (<li> tag with no
	  matching </li>).  Implicit </li> now assumed when it is missing
	  and another <li> tag is encountered.

2004-02-18	Version 1.8.1

	* Fixed Win32 problem with PDB file open call (another M$ 
	  misinterpretation of something pretty standard)

2004-02-05

	* Fixed Win32 portability issue with path separator character

2004-01-26	Version 1.8.0

2004-01-14

	* Changed radius filter distance factors to be more accurate

2004-01-07	Version 1.7.1

	  record (disabled if quiet mode specified)

2004-01-02	Version 1.7.0

	* Added support for reading zipped GPX files (when both zlib and 
	  zziplib are also installed)
	* Fixed a crash in the XML parser if encoding name is missing

2003-12-28	Version 1.6.3

	* Added lookup table for redundant Unicode characters, to replace 
	  those with high ASCII characters in the Palm OS standard fonts

2003-12-27	Version 1.6.2

	* Additional cleanup of UTF-8 decoder

2003-12-22	Version 1.6.1

	* Added proper UTF-8 decoding of text (since Expat apparently 
	  doesn't do it)
	* Removed stripping of high ASCII characters from XML input

2003-12-17	Version 1.6.0

	* Added some more portability checks with autoconf (so, for one,
	  we won't try using the functions needed to reformat dates if 
	  they aren't available and, instead, will just kill that feature)
	* Added --with-expat-dir to configure script, to allow specifying
	  where Expat is installed if it isn't anywhere in the normal 
	  search paths

2003-12-16

	* Added radius filters, for distance from a set of coordinates or 
	  waypoint ID

2003-10-09	Version 1.4.2

	* Fixed bug in cleaning of invalid XML characters when there are
	  two or more of them in a row
	* Added reminder about lack of cache information when importing
	  Geocaching.com LOC files

2003-09-27	Version 1.4.1

	* Fixed getopt.h compile error with Mac OS X
	* Updated man page to be more internationally friendly with the 
	  GPX "state" field, which also handles province names for other 
	  countries

2003-09-25	Version 1.4.0

	* Added -q option (quiet mode)

2003-09-24

	* Added the ability to handle multiple input files

2003-09-23

	* Added filters for found, not-found, country, state, owner,
	  container, type, symbol and travel bugs, most of which are only 
	  applicable to Geocaching.com GPX files
	* The -l option now only lists caches that pass the filters and 
	  waypoint selection
